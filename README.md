# thesolidproject
I am attending a course in Blockchain and Smart Contracts and this is my project while I am learning [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) to code on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/).

## The Organization
I decided to go for a peace project. It's so much bad things going on in the world at the moment, so I want to do something that connects people. Something that makes people feel loved and wanted. My organization is the World, mother Earth, and the thing I want to solve with blockchain is make people love each other instead of hate, kill and humiliate each other.

## The use case
In the 1980s I was using BBS systems connected by modem. In the 1990s I discovered Internet and 1994 I became a user of the operating system Linux. Since then I have always been fascinated about free software and open source, as it's based on what you do and contribute to the movement and community. Not who you are, not the color of your skin, not the God you pray to, not where in the world you were born, not who your parents are and not how much bitcoins you have stacked in your hardware wallet. What's important is what you do and what you contribute with. So can I take this culture with me into the blockchain and make people in this organization called Earth feel appreciated?

## What I want to create
In short: _Token of appreciation_. I want to make a user (Jonas) be able to send a message of appreciation to another user (Vladomir) and make that message stay on the blockchain forever. The message could be whatever the user wants, in free text form.

- Anyone on the internet should be able to see this message with a normal webbrowser.
- Text generation engine, if the user don't know what to send it should be possible to select presets.
- Nice to have: latest messages presented on the frontend application

### What is love?
Plato saw it as a means of ascending to contemplation of the divine; Aristotle viewed it as _seeking the good of the other_. Many modern philosophers consider love to be an essential part of human experience, involving deep interpersonal affection and a _sense of profound connection_.

Psychologists view love in the context of emotions, attachment styles, and human development. They often break love down into components such as intimacy, passion, and _commitment_.

Biologists and neuroscientists look at love as a complex neurobiological phenomenon, driven by hormones and neurotransmitters like dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin. They study how love affects the brain and how it evolved as a mechanism _to promote bonding and survival_.

### What is appreciation?
Appreciation, in its broadest sense, refers to the recognition and enjoyment of the good qualities of someone or something. It encompasses a range of emotions and attitudes, and its manifestations can be both internal and external. At its core, appreciation involves recognizing the value or worth of a person, object, or situation. This recognition often leads to a sense of gratitude or thankfulness.

Appreciation involves a degree of mindfulness or conscious awareness. It's about noticing the qualities, efforts, or meanings that might otherwise be taken for granted. Appreciation is important in personal relationships, where it helps to build and maintain emotional bonds. In professional contexts, showing appreciation can boost morale, motivation, and job satisfaction.

### What is the appreciation token?
A _appreciation token_ is a small gift, gesture, or act that serves as a tangible expression of gratitude or recognition. It is a way of showing appreciation for someone's effort, support, kindness, or achievement. The significance of _a token of appreciation lies not in its monetary value_, but in its _symbolic meaning and the thought behind it_. 

## Things to consider

### Token to be used
- Which type of token should this be?
- Should the user be able to transfer or not?
- Should I use graphics? Like "collectible cards with graphics and message"

> **ERC-20** is the most widely used standard for Ethereum tokens, mainly designed for fungible tokens. They are commonly used for ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and as digital assets or utility tokens.

- The _Appeciation token_ is not an ICO.
- A digital asset refers to any asset that is issued and managed using the blockchain. These assets are digital representations of value or rights that can be transferred and stored electonically. The Appreciation Token could be a digital asset.
- A utility token is a type of cryptocurrency that is issued to fund development of the cryptocurrency and that can be later used to purchase a good or service offered by the issuer. So the Appreciation Token is not an utilty token.

> **ERC-721** is used for non-fungible tokens (NTFs). Each ERC-721 token is unique. They are often used to represent ownership of unique items or assets, such as digital art and collectibles.

- The Appreciation Token is not an item or asset. The Appreciation Token is a message. A message of love.

> **ERC-1155** is a newer standard that allows for both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract. Used by games for items such as weapons, armor and skins.

- This could be the right one for the Appreciation Token.
